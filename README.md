# LlamaCSS-FW
I will start working on a CSS Framework, I will upload it here.

I will try to make it as simple as possible. I will put no unnecessary features.
It will be kind of basic because I make it...

It will be somewhat responsive too.

(By now it's pure CSS, no JavaScript. Excluding demo.html)

If you decide to use it for yourself there is **no need** to credit me, although I would prefer and like if you credited me.

# Customize:
## Edit Colors:
It's really easy. go to `/palette/colors.css` and start edit the colors.

## Edit Scaling Sizes:
Again easy, go to `main.css` and there you'll find `:root` change the `font-size: 14pt` to whatever you like.

# Use:

If you want an easy way to use the style-sheet add this in the <head> of your HTML document:
